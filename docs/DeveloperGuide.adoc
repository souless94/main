== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later.
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F11-4/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson.java`] and link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F11-4/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F11-4/main/tree/master/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F11-4/main/tree/master/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F11-4/main/tree/master/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F11-4/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AppChangedEvent` when the NUS Hangs Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F11-4/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F11-4/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F11-4/main/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F11-4/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]


[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelComponentClassUpdatedOOPDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F11-4/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the NUS Hangs Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::updatedstoragewithgroup.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F11-4/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save NUS Hangs data in xml format when app closes and load it back when app is reopened.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.Erium.commons` package.


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::timetable[]
=== Timetable Feature

As shown in the diagram below, timetable and person classes are associated. A person contains 1 timetable.

image::timetableclassdiagram.png[width="100"]

==== Reason for implementation
The objective of the `add_timetable` feature is to to add data entries of a timetable into NUS Hangs. But it is hard to visualise the adding of the entries so we allowed user to add directly all the entries from a csv file. For `edit_timetable` , it is for User who just want to edit entries without going to find the timetable. For `download_timetable`, it is to allow the user to share their timetable to their friends.

==== How to implement
For `add_timetable` , we create a `timetable` class in `person` first, then we create a `timetableData` class with method to create a String [][] Matrix from the data from the csv file. Then we create a timetableString to which contains information on the entries about the `timetable` and store it in the xml file of the person in the addressbook.

==== Current Implementation

The current `timetable` commands are:

* `add_timetable` -- adds a timetable from the csv file to the person.
* `delete_timetable` -- delete a timetable from the person and creates a default timetable in person. It will also find the timetable csv file of the person and deletes it.
* `edit_timetable` -- edit a timetable timeslot in the person
* `download_timetable` -- downloads a timetable into a csv file into a stored folder location from the person.

These operations are handled by the `logic` component and uses the `person` in `model` to do the execution.

Given below is an activity diagram.

image::timetableworkflow.png[width="500"]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `add_timetable` behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application for the first time. The NUS Hangs will initialise the person with the timetable with the details which was stored using Storage.

Step 2:  user finds a timetable of first `person` in the stored location which is called test7.csv. Using this command, User does not need to type in the timetable name. As shown in the diagram below its easy to see what event the person has.

image::addTimetable-step-2.png[width="500"]

Step 3: The user executes `add_timetable 1` to add the timetable of first `person` in stored folder to NUS hangs. A new `timetable` will be created containing the data of the `timetable` of first `person` in stored folder. The `timetable` of first `person` will be replaced by this new `timetable`.

The `timetable` is then added to storage as a String which contains all of the data. This is to allow the app to save time in storage.


The following sequence diagram shows how `add_timetable` works.

image::addtimetablediagram.png[width="500"]

==== Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 :** adds the timetable via a csv file.
** Pros: Easier for user to visualise and edit his timetable
** Cons: Hard to implement. No choice other than to edit his timetable from the stored folder defined.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice) :** adds the timetable via a csv file from other locations.
** Pros: Easier for user to visualise and edit his timetable and allows user a choice on where to edit his timetable.
** Cons: Hard to implement, and user has to know how to get file location of a file.
* **Alternative 3:** adds the timetable edit by editing the xml file of the person.
** Pros: Easier to implement
** Cons: User must know how to edit via the xml file of the person, and harder for User to visualise.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the add_timetable commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a String [][] Matrix to store entries of the timetable.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. Better intuition to access entries of the matrix (matrix[i][j]) Which makes `edit_timetable` easier to implement.
** Cons: Slower Time efficiency because using 2 for loops to fill the Matrix with the data. Unable to use functions in ArrayList.
* **Alternative 2:** Use ArrayList<ArrayList<String>>
** Pros: Faster Time efficiency because using 1 for loops to fill the Matrix with the data. Able to use functions in ArrayList
** Cons: Harder for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. Less intuition to access entries of the matrix (matrix.get(i).get(j)).
// end::timetable[]

// tag::security-mechanism[]
=== Security Mechanism

==== Reason for Implementation
In a typical interest group setting, there are two main stakeholders. The (1) committee members whom organizes events and the (2) group members whom participates in the event. In this context, these two stakeholders are the main users of NUS Hangs.

The security mechanism is implemented on the following premises:

-	The application is used by the interest group on a shared computer
-	The application is offline
-	Only the two stakeholders mentioned have access to the shared computer

Based on the above premises, the main objectives of the security mechanism include:

•	Restrict group members to read-only commands
•	Only committee members can add and edit information stored in the application

The following activity diagram illustrates the workflow involving security mechanism.


.Activity Diagram of Security Mechanism
image::SecurityMechanismActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]


The three main components that works together to achieve this workflow are:

1.	Account creation
2.	Account login
3.	Validation of login status prior to executing functions



==== Current Implementation


===== *Account Creation*

The first thing a new user must do is to create a new account. To prevent unauthorized members from creating an account, the create command can only be executed if the user is logged in. A default admin account is provided (username: admin, password: adminPassword) to allow the committee members to create their first account.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between the different classes in the process of creating an account.

.Sequence Diagram of Create Command
image::CreateCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

*There are four new classes that are added to AddressBook4 in the implementation of account creation:*

-	CreateCommandParser: parses input arguments and creates a new CreateCommand object
-	CreateCommand: creates a new account for NUS Hangs
-	Accounts: represents an account with username and password fields
-	UserAccountStorage: storage of account credentials in a hashmap

*Minor extensions are added to the other existing classes in AddressBook4:*

-	AddressBookParser: added the create command keyword for parsing
-	ParserUtil: added functions to parse username and password


===== *Login Account*

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between the different classes in the process of logging in to an account. Upon successful login, LoginCommand changes the flag in AddressBookParser to allow users to execute add/edit commands on top of read-only commands.

.Sequence Diagram of Login Command
image::LoginCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

*There are four new classes that are added to AddressBook4 in the implementation of account login:*

-	LoginCommandParser: parses input arguments and creates a new LoginCommand object
-	LoginCommand: login to an account of NUS Hangs
-	Accounts: represents an account with username and password fields
-	UserAccountStorage: retrieval and checking of account credentials in a hashmap

*Minor extensions are added to the other existing classes in AddressBook4:*

-	AddressBookParser: added the login command keyword for parsing, added a check on login status to control commands execution
-	ParserUtil: added functions to parse username and password


==== Design Considerations

*Aspect: Implementation of UserAccountStorage*

*Alternative 1 (current choice): Storing account credentials in a HashMap*

Pros: HashMap is one of the simplest data structures to make use of. It’s especially useful since it maps values to keys. In this case, username serves as keys while the passwords serve as values to be stored in the hashmap.

Cons: By default, adding a duplicate key would overwrite the initial value. i.e. if a username is already used, the password would be changed. To prevent this, we need to implement a function to check for duplicate username before adding the account credentials.

*Alternative 2: Storing account credentials in a LinkedHashMap*

Pros: captures the order of account creation

Cons: LinkedHashMaps is implemented by maintaining a doubly-linked list running through all entries to capture the order. This additional data structure results in additional memory usage.

*Aspect: Implementation of Encrypt*

*Alternative 1(current choice): SHA-256*

Pros: SHA-256 is a one-way hashing algorithm. This means that it is not feasible to invert which prevents unauthorized users from getting the plain text passwords. In version 1.4, NUS Hangs is an offline application situated on a single shared computer. Hence, a simple hash function is adequate in preventing unauthorized users from retrieving the passwords from the application.

Cons: Shorter hash outputs makes it easier to brute force.

*Alternative 2: SHA-512 + Salting*

Pros: Longer hash output that is less predictable protects it from rainbow table attacks.

Cons: Uses more memory space to store the longer hash output.

*Aspect: Validation of Login Status*

*Alternative 1 (current choice): Login Status Flag implemented directly in AddressBookParser*

Pros: This allows for simple implementation to control commands rights

Cons: As the amount of commands increases, this might become difficult to maintain.

*Alternative 2: Creating two different parsers for read-only commands and add/edit commands*

Pros: Easier to maintain as the amount of commands increases

Cons: Requires significant changes to the current architecture.

==== Limitations (version 1.4)

*Account Credentials does not persist*

Account credentials are stored in a hashmap. The problem with the current storage of account credentials is the lack of persistence, i.e. when the user closes the application, the account credentials are lost. In the future version, this problem will be solved either by storing credentials in an external file (such as .xml, .txt) or in a database.


*No restrictions on password*

There are no restrictions on password, namely there is no checks to ensure that the passwords are strong. This means that users can use weak passwords or even leave the password field empty to make it easy to log in.

// end::security-mechanism[]

// tag::groups[]
=== Group Feature

The `Group` class extends the `Entity` abstract class just like a `Person` class does. An `Entity` contains an abstract method `isSame` that is necessary for the class to be used in `UniqueList<T extends Entity>`. `Group` class is an immutable class that is contained inside `Model`.

As shown in the diagram below, group and person classes are associated. Each group contains a UniqueList<Person>, a list of its members. Likewise, each person contains a UniqueList<Group>, a list of all groups he is in. Due to these mutual association, commands editing/deleting instances of group or person may have to edit the corresponding member/group lists respectively. (Refer to DeleteGroupCommand example below.)

.Class Diagram of Group and Person
image::GroupPersonClassDiagram.png[width="600"]

`Group` features make use of `Storage` to load information on groups added by the user before the UI is closed. `XmlAdaptedGroup` class helps the convert groups detail from xml files to the `AddressBook` when `MainApp` starts and similarly convert `Group` objects into xml files.

`Group` features also updates the Group Panel inside the `UI` using a predicate.

==== Current Implementation
The current group commands added are:

* `add_group`/`ag` -- adds a group with an optional description
* `delete_group/`dg`` -- deletes a group and all references from its members to it
* `edit_group`/`eg` -- edit name/description of a group while maintaining uniqueness of all group names
* `find_group`/`fg` -- search for groups using keywords that must match exactly a word in Group name
* `register`/`r` -- register a member into an existing group and include a reference to the group in the member (Person class)
* `delete_member/`dm` -- delete an existing member from an existing group and remove reference to that group in the member
* `view_group`/`vg` -- view the existing members in the group and is updated whenever any member is added or deleted.
* `list [person_index]`/`l [person_index]` -- lists all the groups the person at `[person_index]` is currently in.

These functions and their parsers are handled in `Logic`, before updating `Model` and `Storage` and displaying the updated result on the `UI`.

==== An Example: DeleteGroupCommand
The DeleteGroupCommand is a good example of how Group and Person classes are interacting (dependent and associated with each other). An example usage scenario of how `delete_group` behaves at each stop is explained below.

Step 1: The user launches the application. (We assume that the user has already added a group and person.) `VersionedAddressBook` will be loaded with the final addressbook state before the application was closed. Lists of groups and persons added previously will be loaded from `addressbook.xml` file into `Model` using `XmlAdaptedPerson` and `XmlAdaptedGroup` classes. Updated lists will be displayed in the `UI`.

.Sequence Diagram of DeleteGroupCommand (Logic component)
image::DeleteGroupCommandLogicSD.png[width="750"]

Step 2: The user enters the command `dg n/Family` to delete the existing group with group name Family.

* The `LogicManager` class parses the command to `AddressBookParser`. `AddressBookParser` creates a `DeleteGroupCommandParser` instance which parses the String "Family" into a `Name` name. The parser creates a `Group` gr with the name (Family). This group is needed for the function below.

* The parser creates a `DeleteGroupCommand` object with parameters gr. Subsequently, `retrieveGroupFromName(m, gr.getName())` is called to the Model component in order to retrieve the actual group with the name "Family".

.Sequence Diagram of DeleteGroupCommand (Model component)
image::DeleteGroupCommandModelSD.png[width="700"]
* After retrieving the actual group `g` with name "Family" from Model `m`, the model performs deletion of the group using an internal function `delete(g)`.

* However, the group still has to be deleted from the groupList from all of its members. _(Refer to GroupPersonClassDiagram above.)_ `deleteGroupFromMembers(m, g)` is called from DeleteGroupCommand object to do so. This method calls the `UnModifiableObservableList()` method in its UniqueList<Person> to return a list of `members` in `g`. For every `member` in the list of `members` (for loop), `updatePersonDeleteGroupFromGroupList(m, g, member)` deletes the reference to `g` in `member`.

* Finally, the address book is committed with all the changes.

Step 4: `FilteredPersonList` and `FilteredGroupList` is also updated correspondingly to display the new groups and persons in the `UI`. A successful message is also displayed to the user below the UI's command box.

Step 5: Before the application is closed, all groups and persons are stored in `addressbook.xml` using `XmlAdaptedGroup` and `XmlAdaptedPerson` classes. _(Refer to High level sequence diagrams Figure 3 and 4 for a similar illustration of the concept.)_

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to implement `Group` class

*Alternative 1 (current choice):* `Group` as an immutable class.

Pros: Immutable objects are good Map keys and Set elements, since these typically do not change once created. Immutability makes it easier to write, use and reason about the code.

Cons: Doing so might restrict the way one can call the class and its methods. It may be slower as you have to create new objects with every command.

*Alternative 2:* Setter methods for Groups

Pros: Easier and less code for methods involving groups. Faster as do not have to create new objects each time you change a Group (e.g. edit its description or group members).

Cons: Miss out on the advantages of immutable object (above). Good practice to use immutable objects.

===== Aspect: Interactions between person and groups

Deleting a person from a group will affect the person's reference to that group and vice versa (similar for adding and editing).

*Alternative 1 (current choice):* Having a `UniqueList<Groups>` in `Person` and `UniqueList<Person>` in `Group`.

Pros: Easy to retrieve groups from Person and persons from Group. Existing `UniqueList` class available (since already used in `Model`).

Cons: Have to update both lists in most group commands (e.g. registering a new member in a group). Issue of enforcing referential integrity - defensive programming.

*Alternative 2* Just update the list of groups in `Model` and have person refer to that list of group as to whether it is a member of the group.

Pros: Less issues with enforcing referential integrity (see alternative 1).

Cons: Can be more expensive to look for groups for a particular person.
// end::groups[]

// tag::person-feature[]
=== Person Feature

The 'Person' class extends the `Entity` abstract class and it is contained within `Model`.

`Person` feature make use of `Timetable` and `Group` class to assign respective information to each instance of a person.

==== Current Implementation

The current person implementation are:

* `add` -- add any person with the choice of adding address, phone, email and tags
* `find` -- finds all persons in NUSHangs, whose contain keywords provided by prefix(es)

==== Reasons for Implementation

The ability to add and find members with flexibility improves the user’s experience of the application.

The `add` command allows users to include or omit particulars of any member.

* This is helpful as the user may not always have all of the particulars of its members.
* This also promotes flexibility as to how users want to control the information, which can be useful for organising events.

The `find` command allows users to find members based on certain particulars.

* This is useful for interest groups as they can find members based on certain particulars.
* For example, organisers can find and group users by level of proficiency to perform an event; or
* The organisers can find based on address to get people who stays close to school to reach earlier to perform certain setup

==== Activity & Sequence Diagram: An example to FindCommand

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the Logic component for the - execute("find n/alex") API call.

image::FindSequence.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram shows how 'find' feature works:

image::FindActivity.png[width="600"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How should each specific `find` feature work

*Alternative 1 (Current Choice) :* Use prefixes for specific search (e.g. find n/alex bernice t/friends)

Pros: Higher flexibility. Greater control of search range.

Cons: Harder to implement.

*Alternative 2 :* Create a class for each information (e.g. find_address)

Pros: Easy to implement, with specific search focus.

Cons: Repetitive code base with less flexibility.

===== Aspect: How should `add` feature work

*Alternative 1 (Current Choice) :* Allow optional prefix (e.g. add n/alex t/friends)

Pros: Higher flexibility. Allow users to gain greater control over particulars.

Cons: Harder to implement.

*Alternative 2 :* Only name input is required (e.g. add alex)

Pros: Simple command for users.

Cons: Unable to utilize or classify information when needed.

=== Time slot Feature

The time slot feature makes use of the `Timetable` and `Group` classes each `Person` class is associated with to find the common time slots within the members of a group for easier planning of events and outings.

==== Current Implementation
The current time slot commands added are:

* `view_slots_all`/`va` -- lists all time slots at which every member of a specfied group is free at
* `view_slots_ranked`/`vr` -- sorts and lists all time slots in terms of number of members available, for a specified group and specified required minimum number of people

The activity diagram is as follows.

image::timeslotactivitydiagram.png[width="800"]

These methods and their parsers are handled in `Logic`, and compares the `Timetable` associated with each `Person` in a specified `Group` during execution. Given below is the Sequence Diagram illustrating the interactions between the various classes when finding the aforementioned slots.

image::timeslotsequencediagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How should time tables be compared when view_slots_all is executed

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Get a 2d boolean array based on the 2d string array data in the `Timetable` associated with each `Person` to determine if the `Person` is free at a particular time slot.

Pros: The true/false nature of a 2d boolean array is intuitive when determining if a person is free. No strings have to be parsed during the method call, which allows for faster comparisons.

Cons: It will be harder to implement additional features based on the 2d boolean array as its entries can only be true or false.

* Alternative 2: Directly compare the 2d string array of the `Timetable` class associcated with each `Person`

Pros: Less code needed and debugging would be easier. Furthermore, implementation would also be more direct.

Cons: If there are many `Person` in a group, it will take a longer time to find the available slots as every string entry in the 2d string array has to be parsed to check if the `Person` is free at a particular time slot.

====== Aspect: How should time slots be sorted when view_slots_ranked is executed

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Store the available time slots in a treemap with the key being the slots in integer form, and the value being the number of people available at the that slot.

Pros: Very fast and can be easily sorted in terms of number of people available using a custom comparator while collecting the elements in a linkedhashmap. This preserves the order of the elements so that they are first sorted in number of people available and then in terms of timing. While iterating through the linkedhashmap, it can return immediately when a slot has less people available than required.

Cons: Complex implementation as it requires the use of lambda functions, streams and various data structures.

* Alternative 2: Store the available time slots with its corresponding number of people available in an arraylist as an integerdouble and sorting at the end with collections.sort and a custom comparator.

Pros: Very easy to implement.

Cons: Very slow due to O(n) find and deletion.

====== Aspect: How should the results be returned

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Return the results in a form of a string

Pros: Relatively fast due to stringbuilder and easy to implement.

Cons: Harder to use and manipulate the results for implementation of other features.

* Alternative 2: Return the results in a form of a `Timetable`

Pros: Can be used in various ways due to the available timetable methods and can also be downloaded as an excel file.

Cons: Harder to implement and debug.

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F11-4/main/tree/master/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F11-4/main/tree/master/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F11-4/main/tree/master/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing
=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F11-4/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

eryone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.
