== PROJECT: NUS Hangs

---

== Overview

NUS Hangs is a desktop Schedule Manager application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). It is a Java application written by developers of F11-4, to target small/mid-size interest/study groups in NUS.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: implemented security mechanism
** What it does: manages command execution rights to two main stakeholders
*** Guest users (users without account): can only execute read-only commands
*** Admins (users with account): can execute all commands accessible by guest users. On top of that, is able to execute commands related to add and editing of data.
** Justification: This feature secures the information stored in the application by preventing unauthorised users from manipulating it, while allowing all users to view the data. +
An example of a situation where this would be useful is in the context of an interest group. In an interest group, committee members would need to organize activities while maximizing attendance. In that case, only the committee members should have the rights to add and update the information within the application. After the committee members setup the schedule, members whom are interested would be able to gain read-only access to view the information available. Alternatively, members could also access the application to verify if the information are accurate.




* *Minor enhancement*: *added an encrypt function*
** What it does: encrypts password before storage to prevent compromising of password information.
